Investigating input uncertainty in simulation analytics

Experiments using a network of three consecutive M/M/1 queues, where final node undergoes maintenance

Two RMarkdown scripts to analyse results using m = 500 input data observations, versus m = 10000.

The results files can be generated using the sim_exp.R file
